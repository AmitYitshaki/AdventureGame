            ADVENTURE GAME - BONUS FEATURES REQUEST
=====================================================================

We request bonus points for the following:

1. EXERCISE 3 BONUS: SAVE/LOAD GAME STATE
   --------------------------------------
   * Full State Serialization:
     We implemented a complete Save/Load system (triggered by 'S' in the Pause menu
     or '3' in the Main Menu).
   * What it saves:
     - Exact positions of both players.
     - Inventory status (Lives, Scores, Items held).
     - State of all objects (Doors open/closed, Keys taken, Switches toggled).
     - The current map layout (including destroyed walls).
     - The Random Seed (to ensure consistency).
