            ADVENTURE GAME - BONUS FEATURES REQUEST
=====================================================================

We have implemented several features that go beyond the mandatory requirements
of Exercise 2. We request bonus points for the following:

1. VISUALS & AUDIO (POLISH)
   ------------------------
   * Color System (Configurable):
     Implemented a full color system for better UX (Green springs, Red bombs, etc.).
     Includes a menu option to toggle colors ON/OFF as required for the bonus.
   * Sound Effects:
     Added audio cues (using Windows Beep) for Spring launch, and bomb explosions(if more sounds are needed for 	Bonus please mention and we will add for: collecting items, changing room's loosing a life,riddle and so on. (did not want to exaggerate)
     Includes a menu option to toggle sound ON/OFF.
   * Visual Bomb Countdown:
     Bombs display a visual countdown timer ('3' -> '2' -> '1') on the board 
     before exploding, giving players clear feedback.

2. NEW GAME MECHANICS
   ------------------
   * Laser Gates:
     Added a custom "Laser" object type not listed in the standard requirements.
     Lasers act as togglable barriers controlled by Switches (Logic Gates).
   * Restart Level:
     Added a "Quality of Life" feature allowing players to restart ONLY the
     current level upon death, instead of forcing a full game restart.

3. RIDDLE SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS
   --------------------------
   * Random Shuffling:
     if decided by Game Level designer Riddles are not presented in a fixed order. The game loads them from
     `Riddles.txt` and randomly shuffles them using a time-based seed,
     ensuring a unique experience every run.

4. SYSTEM STABILITY
   ----------------
   * Robust Error Handling (GameException):
     Went beyond basic requirements by implementing a custom Exception class
     that catches file errors or logic faults and allows the game to return
     safely to the Main Menu instead of crashing to the desktop.
